This directory is for generating c source code from SUN Pascal code.

runp2c is a csh script for running p2c using the parameter settings taken
from ./loc.p2crc.  All .p files in the current directory are translated
and written to .c files in the destination directory. The variable
DEST in runp2c controls the destination.


NOTE for p2c users
------------------
p2c version 1.2 was used.  If you have p2c installed, these programs
require one modification. In the p2c/src directory, replace the procedure
makeexpr_hat in the file expr.c with the modified version in the file
makeexpr_hat.fix.c and recompile p2c. This fixes a 'bug' in the original p2c.
See comments in makeexpr_hat.c for a full explanation.
