This directory contains the Pascal source code for the XYELM package. If
you simply wish to recompile the programs for you local system, follow
the directions below. If you plan on porting them to a new compiler,
read the documentation files in the pascal_tools directory.

*****************************************
Re-compiling the programs
*****************************************

1. Copy the programs to the 'install' directory.

cp *.p install


2. Move to the 'install' directory and compile the programs.

cd install
compile.csh &                         {& runs compilation in the background} 


The script compile.csh writes executable code directly to xylem/bin, using
the name with no file extension (eg. splitdb.p is compiled and written to
xylem/bin/splitdb). By default, the code is statically linked at 
compile time using the -BSTATIC option. If your system has Pascal libraries
you can save some disk space by recompiling without that option. See the
comments in compile.csh for more information.

*****************************************
Translating the programs to c
*****************************************

The directory p2c has files for use with David Gillespie's p2c program
for translation of these programs to c. You must install p2c first
before trying to do this. p2c-generated files directly compileable
on Sun4 and HP9000 systems is available in the directory src.c.
For other systems, you may need to change translation parameters found
in loc.p2crc.
