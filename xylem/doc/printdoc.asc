      NAME
           printdoc - prints documentation files
      
      SYNOPSIS
           printdoc filename 
      
      DESCRIPTION
           printdoc uses the file extension to decide how to print a
           documentation file. If necessary, a filter such as pr or nroff
           is used to format the file before sending to the appropriate 
           printer. A list of file extensions recognized by printdoc is
           given below. If no file extension is given, or the extension is
           not in the list, printdoc assumes .doc.

           .doc - (default)  Uses pr to print the text, using the default
           settings provided by pr (56 text lines per page plus a 5 line
           header and footer). Printing is at 12 cpi, front only. This works
           reasonbly well for most unformatted documentation files,
           provided  that the line length doesn't exceed 80 char. This
           option assumes that a half-inch left margin is automatically
           provided by the printer.

           .tex - Assumes that document is already pre-formatted. Thus, 
           no headers or footers are provided, and it is assumed that
           the top and bottom of pages are padded with blanks or header/
           footer lines as needed. Form-feed characters (^L) may be
           included in the text to force page breaks. 

           .ps - Assumes file is in PostScript format. Sends it to the
           PostScript printer.

           .nroff - Assumes file is formatted for use by nroff, using the
           standard macro set (nroff -ms).

           .nroff.me - Assumes file is formatted for use by nroff, using the
           e  macro set (nroff -me).

      TRANSPORTATION NOTES
           For reasons which should be obvious, this script needs major
           rewriting at each site, since the available printers will
           be of different types and have different names.
