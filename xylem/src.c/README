The programs in this directory have been tested with the following C
compilers:

  cc    Sun
  cc    HP/UX
  gcc   Sun
  gcc   AIX

To compile programs:

   1.  Choose the appropriate p2c.h file, and copy it to p2c.h:

       file                      works with
       -----------------------------------------------------
       p2c.h.sun                 Sun cc
       p2c.h.standard            IBM AIX gcc
       p2c.h.HP                  HP/UX

      ex.  cp p2c.h.HP p2c.h


    2. If you are using GNU C, comment out cc in Makefile and uncomment gcc.

    3. To compile,

    make 

To copy executable code to the 'bin' directory:

    make install


To get rid of object files etc. when done:

    make clean
