      NAME
           fil.py - create a set of world-readable .fil files for use by fasta.
      
      SYNOPSIS
           python fil.py [-e extension]
          
      
      DESCRIPTION
           The GenBank flat file database is divided into divisions
           (eg. PLN=plant, PRI=primate, EST=est). A full list of divisions
           in included in the file gbrel.txt, accompanying each GenBank
           release. Each division is stored one or more files, depending
           on the size of the division. If only one file is needed,
           the files take the form gb<div>.seq. For example, the unannotated
           division of GenBank takes the form gbuna.seq. Where 2 or more
           files are present for a division, a number is appended to the
           name. For example, the EST division consists of gbest1.seq,
           gbest2.seq, gbest3.seq... 
           
           The fasta programs of Bill Pearson read the names of these files
           during database searches. For example, to search the bacterial
           division of GenBank, the file gbbct.fil would be read, which
           contains:
           
           </home/psgendb/GenBank
           gbbct1.wrp 0
           gbbct2.wrp 0
           gbbct3.wrp 0
           gbbct4.wrp 0
           gbbct5.wrp 0
           
           (For use with the XYLEM package, the .wrp extension is
           used for esquence files, rather than .seq)
           
           The problem is that as the database increases in size,
           the number of divisions increase, and the .fil files
           must be changed each time. To automate the creation
           of these files, fil.py reads a the file 'filnum'. An
           example would be:
           
           est 161
           gss 51
           htg 33
           htc 1 
           pri 19
           pln 5
           bct 5
           inv 5 
           rod 3
           sts 2
           vrl 3
           vrt 1
           mam 1
           pat 4 
           syn 1
           phg 1
           una 1
 
           Thus, the est.fil would contain a list of 161 file names
           for the EST division, gss.fil would contain a list of
           51 filenames for the GSS division etc. In addition to
           the individual division files, 'genbank.fil' contains
           a list of all files in all divisions. The FASTA programs
           read the file 'fastgbs', which contains the names of
           all .fil files. 
           
           To summarize, fil.py reads filnum, and creates all the
           corresponding .fil files containing the appropriate filenames.
           The POSIX file mode is changed to 0644 (ie. world-readable)
           for all .fil files.
           
      OPTIONS
           -e  By default, the filename extension 'wrp' is used
               for sequence filenames. Another extension can
               be specified with the -e option. For example,
               "-e fsa" would create filenames such as
               "gbmam.fsa".
