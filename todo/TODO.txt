Add version numbers to all sources that i've aquired
Need sources for:

-mrtrans (can't find)
-mapmaker3 (can't find )
-weblogo (isn't C )
-cap3 (can't get source, but binaries available for some platforms at http://seq.cs.iastate.edu/cap3.html )

to build:
-ncbi (legacy, but i've also found ncbi+ sources as well at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/toolbox/ )


Need further testing of:

-phylip
-FASTA
-xylem
-fsap
-mrbayes
-weighbor
-DIALIGN 
-primer3

Probably lots of work:

-tcoffee  (perl modules, etc)
-emboss (uses automake?)
