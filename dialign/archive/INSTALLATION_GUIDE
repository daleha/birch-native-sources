                          DIALIGN2 
                          ========
    
                   program code written by  

           Burkhard Morgenstern and Said Abdeddaim

(1) cd to the directory `src' that contains the dialign source code 

(2) type `make' to compile the program. This should create an executable
    binary file called `dialign2-2'.

(3) you may remove all object files (type `rm *.o')

(4) to run DIALIGN2, you must create an environment variable 
    `DIALIGN2_DIR' pointing to the directory `dialign2_dir' 

    (type `setenv DIALIGN2_DIR /your_path/dialign2_dir/' where 
    `your_path' is the directory where you de-tarred the file with the
    sources)  

    The program needs the files 

       tp400_dna
       tp400_prot
       tp400_trans
       BLOSUM 
 
    that are contained in the directory `dialign2_dir'. You may move 
    these files to any other directory and set DIALIGN2_DIR accordingly.



Please note that, unlike in the first version of DIALIGN, it is NOT 
POSSIBLE to replace the BLOSUM matrix by other similarity matrices !!

DIALIGN comes with a detailed user guide. For additional information, please 
consult the DIALIGN home page at
