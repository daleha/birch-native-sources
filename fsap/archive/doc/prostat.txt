                                    PROSTAT

     I. Function- PROSTAT reads in a protein sequence and prints a report 
     listing amino acid composition and molecular weight.
          
     II. Program Flow
     Below is the screen output of a typical interactive session with PROSTAT. 
     Program output and user responses are listed as they would actually 
     appear on the screen.  Comments, which are listed here for explanatory 
     purposes but would not appear in the program, are enclosed in the 
     symbols (* *).

     III. What the Output Means

     1.  The molecular weight is calculated by calculating the amino acid
     composition of the protein, and adding the products of the molecular
     weights of the amino acids (minus water) times their mole fraction in
     the protein.  The molecular weight of water (18) is added to the sum to
     account for hydration of the N & C termini. Asx and Glx are assigned
     a molecular weight of 114.5 and 128.5, respectively.  Unknown amino
     acids (X) are assigned the average molecular weight of 119. 
     
     2.  Amino acid composition is listed as both the number of each amino
     acid in the protein and the mole fraction of each amino acid.
