This directory contains sample input and output files for use with the
FSAP package.

testfsap.csh assumes that executable codefiles are in a
system dependent bin directory. In testfsap.csh, 
uncomment one of the following lines to specify
which platform you are using:

#set BINDIR = "../bin-solaris-sparc"
#set BINDIR = "../bin-solaris-AMD64"
#set BINDIR = "../bin-linux-intel"


To test the WHOLE package, type 

    testfsap.csh > test.log

This will test all the programs, and send output
to a file called test.log.


To test a SPECIFIC program, type

     testfsap.csh program_name
