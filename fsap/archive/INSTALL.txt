A. The Files
------------

1. If you are reading this, you have already successfully
downloaded, uncompressed and un-tarred fsap.tar.Z. You should now
have the following files and directories in your "fsap" directory:

drwx------   2 frist    drr         4096 Mar 29 12:40 bin-linux-intel/
drwx------   2 frist    drr         4096 Mar 29 12:12 bin-solaris-amd64/
drwx------   2 frist    drr         4096 Apr  2 16:11 bin-solaris-sparc/
drwx------   3 frist    drr         4096 Dec  6  2003 dat/
drwx------   2 frist    drr         4096 Apr  2 15:11 doc/
drwxr-xr-x   2 frist    drr         4096 Apr  2 17:06 GDE/
-rw-------   1 frist    drr         7041 May  3  1996 INSTALL.txt
-rw-------   1 frist    drr         3666 Mar 29 10:45 RELEASE.NOTES
drwx------   4 frist    drr         4096 Mar 29 11:35 src/
drwx------   2 frist    drr         4096 Apr  2 16:11 src.c/
drwx------   2 frist    drr         4096 Apr  2 16:35 test/


Each of the 3 bin directories has binaries compiled for the three
supported platforms: Linux-Intel, Solaris-AMD64 and Solaris-Sparc.
Move the files appropriate for your platform to a bin directory
that is in your $PATH, or add the appropriate bin directory
to your $PATH.

B. Compiling the programs (if necessary)
----------------------------------------

1. PASCAL code (sun4 only)
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
On most Sun Sparc systems, you should be able to use the pre-
compiled binaries, and can skip this section. Should you need to
recompile, (eg. you wish to change program constants) the directory
src/pascal_tools contains the tools necessary for recompiling and
modifying the programs. Modification of the programs is discussed
later in this document. 

First, copy the Pascal source to src/install:

cd src
cp *.p install

Next, 

cd install
compile.csh

to compile the programs using the Sun Pascal compiler.  By default,
compile.csh will compile all files with the ".p" extension and
write the executable code to the "bin" directory. Executable code 
will have library routines loaded at compile time, meaning that
they should run even on workstations that do not have Pascal
libraries on line. 

You can modify compile.csh to write binaries to any directory you
wish, or to load library routines dynamically, if your workstation
has Pascal libraries. See comments in compile.csh for more
information.

2. C code (Sun, HP)
- - - - - - - - - 

C code is provided in the directory src.c. See README for more information.
Note: So far, this C code has only been tested on Sun4 and HP900 Unix
systems, and for non-Sun use, you should consider XYLEM to be 
an application under development. Everything SEEMS to work, but more
rigorous testing and development is needed to make the C code 
portable for a wide range of platforms.

C. Copying files
----------------

Make sure the files in the bin directory are world
readable/executable:

cd bin
chmod 755 *

Copy the contents of the "bin" directory to the directory in which
you wish the executables to reside. For example:

cp  *  /usr/local/bin


Copy the contents of the doc directory to the directory in which
you wish documentation to reside. For example, 

cd ../doc
cp *.doc /usr/local/doc/fsap

You may wish to set an environment variable in your .cshrc file telling
where the documentation is. For example, if $doc is set as follows,

setenv doc /usr/local/doc

then '$doc/fsap' would be the directory for FSAP documentation.


D. Setting environment variables and path
-----------------------------------------

The location of the FSAP programs must added to the $path
environment variable. For example, your .cshrc file might contain

set path = ($path usr/local/bin)

if you had copied the programs to /usr/local/bin (Note: if /usr/local/bin
is already in your $path, you don't need to do this).

Finally, make sure that 'noclobber' is not set in your .cshrc file. That is,
comment out of your .cshrc file any line that says

set noclobber

This command prevents the overwriting of already existing files, which is
necessary for many FSAP programs. To comment it out, simply put a '#' in
the first column:

#set noclobber

II. WHAT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO INSTALL ALL OF FSAP?
***************************************************

All FSAP programs are 'standalone'. You can pick and choose which you
wish to install.

III. SPECIAL INSTALLATION NOTES FOR GDE
*********************************************

While most FSAP programs have have easy-to-use menus for text-only terminals,
they are even more powerful when used with the Genetic Data
Environment (GDE) by Steven Smith (available by anonymous FTP at
golgi.harvard.edu). GDE is essentially a generic user interface
that programs. Intrinsically, GDE contains a sequence alignment
editor and a number of other functions. In addition to its
intrinsic functions, GDE reads in information necessary to call
other programs from a file called .GDEmenus. For each program added
to GDE, .GDEmenus contains an entry specifying what should appear
in a pop-up menu (eg. choice buttons, pull-down "chooser" menus,
sliders for numerical arguments, or free text), as well as the
command to be issued by GDE to call the program.  

The following FSAP programs are available for use in GDE:
FUNNEL
NUMSEQ
BACHREST
P1HOM
P2HOM
D3HOM
D4HOM
TESTCODE

While these programs can not be run using command line options, shell
scripts have been written that, given the values of parameters from GDE,
can generate the user responses necessary for running these interactive
programs, For example, the flow of information to run NUMSEQ is as follows:

GDE numseq menu --> numseq.csh --> numseq --> textedit

Assuming that both GDE and FSAP
are already running on your system, getting GDE to call FSAP programs
requires only two steps: 1) adding the menu items found in
xylem/GDE/FSAP.GDEmenus to the .GDEmenus file 2) Copying the shell
scripts to the bin directory where they will reside (eg. /usr/local/bin).
More specific instructions can be found in fsap/GDE.

IV. RE-COMPILING AND MODIFYING FSAP PROGRAMS
*********************************************

See src/README.

V. Clean up
*************

Assuming that you have copied executables into a centrally-
located 'bin' directory (eg. /usr/local/bin) and documentation
into a centrally-located 'doc' directory (eg. $doc/fsap) you
can delete the entire fsap directory.  If you are using FSAP with GDE,
you need to install the files from the 'GDE' directory as described above
before deleting this directory.
