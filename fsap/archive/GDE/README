The file FSAP.GDEmenus contains GDE menu items for many of the FSAP programs
Installation instructions are inculded as comment lines at the top of that file.

Additionally, you must copy all of the .csh files in this directory to the
same directory as the other FSAP executables. This might most simply be
done by copying these .csh files to fsap/bin-xxx-xxx at the same time you
copy the FSAP executables to fsap/bin-xxx-xxx. Then everything can be copied
to the final 'bin' directory en masse.

The following table summarizes the relationships between files and menu
items:

GDE menu item       shell script called by GDE    program(s) called by script
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Import Free Format  free2gb.csh                   funnel
NUMSEQ              numseq.csh                    numseq
BACHREST            bachrest.csh                  bachrest
DXHOM               hom.csh                       d3hom, d4hom
PXHOM               phom.csh                      p1hom,p2hom
TESTCODE            testcode.csh                  testcode

Because the FSAP programs are interactive and can't be directly run
through command line options, GDE generates a command as if the program
COULD be run from the command line, and the script reads the command
line arguments and generates user responses that would normally be
typed at program prompts. These responses are then piped to the
program as standard input. Consequently, all screen output that would
normally appear at the user's terminal will appear in the window in which
GDE was started up. Finally, output that would normally be sent to the
output file is piped into a textedit window.
