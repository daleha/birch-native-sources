The code in this directory has been tested on the following systems:
      SunOS     cc   and gcc
      IBM AIX   xlc  and gcc

You are free to try to adapt it to your own system. If you are
successful, please send me a detailed description of what 
you have done for adaptation.

The code in this directory has been created using p2c version 1.21.

1. Choose the appropriate makefile
----------------------------------
Simply copy one of the platform-specific makefiles
to Makefile. For example, if you are on a Linux
Intel system, 

cp Makefile.linux-intel Makefile


2. Prepare files for compilation (probably not necessary). 
-----------------------------------------------------------
   HP/UX system 

         cp p2c.h.HP p2c.h


   GNU gcc compiler (Sun and IBM AIX)

         cp p2c.h.gcc p2c.h

         Edit Makefile to change the CC variable from 'cc' to 'gcc'.

   IBM AIX systems with the xlc compiler:

         Edit Makefile to change the CC variable from 'cc' to 'xlc'.

3. Compile the programs
-----------------------

    make 

4. Copy executable code to the 'bin' directory:
-----------------------------------------------
    make install

5. Clean up temporary files
---------------------------

    make clean

6. Compiling for multiple platforms
-----------------------------------

If you need to compile for more than one platform,
run 'make clean', and then recompile for the next
platform.
