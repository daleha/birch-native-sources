To compile the weighbor program you will need an ANSI compliant C
compiler. Specifically the compiler must be able to parse function
prototypes. The GNU C compiler (gcc) is ANSI compliant, some old
sun compilers are not (although acc is).

Edit the Makefile and change the CC variable to the name of your C
compiler and adjust the CFLAGS variable as desired (currently it is
set to compile with debugging information added, change to optimized
compilation if desired).

Then simply type make to compile the program. make clean will delete
temporary files and make spotless will delete all but the source code.

See the files in the Doc subdirectory for information on how to run
the program.
